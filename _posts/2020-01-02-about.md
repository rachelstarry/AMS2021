# Call for Proposals

<p class="content">Ancient MakerSpaces showcases digital approaches to the study of the ancient world. Since 2017 (and with a brief hiatus in 2020), Ancient MakerSpaces has served as a venue at the AIA-SCS Annual Meeting for scholars, librarians, and students to share their ongoing digital scholarship and pedagogical work, as well as a space for hands-on, peer-based learning about digital resources and computational methods.

We invite presentation proposals for digital projects at all stages, whether you are prototyping or published. AMS 2021 will combine lightning talks, project demos, and (potentially) hands-on workshops that present digital tools, platforms, repositories, or techniques for engaging with ancient texts and material culture.</p>
