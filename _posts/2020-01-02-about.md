# Call for Proposals
{: .text-turquoise}

<p class="content">Ancient MakerSpaces showcases digital approaches to the study of the ancient world. Since 2017 (and with a brief hiatus in 2020), Ancient MakerSpaces has served as a venue at the AIA-SCS Annual Meeting for scholars, librarians, and students to share their ongoing digital scholarship and pedagogical work, as well as a space for hands-on, peer-based learning about digital resources and computational methods.</p>

<p class="content">We invite presentation proposals for digital projects at all stages, from prospective to published. AMS 2021 will combine lightning talks, project demos, and (potentially) hands-on workshops that present digital tools, platforms, repositories, or techniques for engaging with ancient texts and material culture.</p>

<p class="content">Submissions from all disciplines within ancient studies are welcome, and we particularly welcome proposals that engage with the following approaches:</p>

- AR/VR environments
- digital mapping
- text encoding, annotating, or editing
- network analysis
- digitization and modeling (including epigraphic or numismatic materials)
- linked open data or data preservation
<br/>
